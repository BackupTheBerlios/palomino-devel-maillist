Branch Manager,
United Bank For Africa Plc
Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria
My Personal E-mail:dr_hassanbello at irangate.net
Attn:President/Ceo. 

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable
business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you
before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of
Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for
a confidential business. I am the manager of United Bank for Africa Plc
(UBA), Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria. The intended business is thus; We
had a customer, a Foreign resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with
one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch
the sum ofUS 22.6 Million (Twenty Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand U.S
{Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died three years ago until today non-of
his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed
this, 

I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank have covered
up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be
fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other
relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We
will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the
claims. The whole procedures will last only five working days to get the
fund retrieved successfully without trace even now or in future. Your
response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all
necessary things.

As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating
your interest, then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to
ensure that the deal is successfully concluded. For your assistance we
have agreed to give you twenty five percent (25%) of the Total sum at
the end of the transaction while 65% would be for my colleagues and I
and the remaining 10% would be for any form of expenses that may be
incurred during the course of the transaction which would be given to us
when the money is transferred into your account before splitting the
balance on the agreed percentage of 65% to 25%. In order to get all the
legal documents from the court, kindly send the following information to
us immediately. Your full name, telephone, mobile and fax numbers as
well as your resident or company address. I await your earliest
response.Please reply through my personal
email:dr_hassanbello at irangate.net

Thanks, 

Yours Sincerely,

Dr Hassan Bello
